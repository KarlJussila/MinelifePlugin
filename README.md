# MinelifePlugin
This is a plugin I made for a Minecraft server in 2016-2017.

## Feature: Claiming and Raiding
Implemented land claiming and raiding systems that allow players to claim small plots of land or large swaths of land with a town. Claims are maintained by gold and logs, and they are raided using weapons of various tiers. Towns expand as they gain more resources, capped at a 200 block (meter) radius, but plots remain 9x9x9. I later implemented alternative methods of raiding, including the use of ranged weapons and machines to automate some of the process.

## Feature: Dynamic Chat
I also implemented a chat system that had three range options. A player could type normally to send a message to nearby players, shout by preceding their message with a "!" to reach more distant players, or chat globally by preceding their messages with a "*".

## Feature: Admin Claims
I also added claims to be used by admins of the server, allowing them to make unraidable towns or rectangular selections with customizable features using chat commands.

Developed 2016-2017, made for Minecraft 1.12.2 (has not been tested or updated in recent years)
